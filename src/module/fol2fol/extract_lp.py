### Task: For each given **First-Order Logic (FOL) predicate**, generate a clear and accurate **natural language definition** that faithfully captures its intended meaning based on the given natural language passage.

You are given:
- A list of **FOL predicates** that represent logical relations or properties in the domain of discourse.
- Each predicate has a name that encodes its meaning in English (or composed of meaningful English tokens).
- Each predicate takes a specific number of arguments (e.g., x, y), which represent entities involved in that relationship.

#### Your Goal:
For every predicate, write **a full, grammatically complete English sentence** that:
- Clearly reflects the **intended logical meaning** of the predicate name and its arguments.
- Specifies the **role** of each argument in the relationship (e.g., who performs an action, who receives it).
- Is a **grammatically correct and complete sentence** with a clear subject and verb.
- **Does not require an external passage** — rely only on the meaning inferred from the predicate name and its argument structure.

### Instructions:
1. **Define each FOL predicate as a complete, well-formed natural language sentence**:
     - **Analyze the predicate carefully** to understand its logical meaning and the roles of its arguments.
     - Use the **predicate name and argument structure** to determine the most natural and complete way to express its meaning in English.
     - Write a **single, grammatically complete sentence** that fully defines the predicate.
     - Clearly describe what the predicate name refers to — especially if it involves a specific category.
     - Ensure that the sentence **explicitly describes the roles of all arguments** (e.g., who performs an action, who receives it).
       
2. **Rules for constructing the definition**:
    - The definition must be a complete sentence with a clear subject and verb (predicate) structure.
    - The definition must **not be vague or overly general**.
    - Do not **modify, rename, or infer** beyond the given predicate name.
    - **Do not merge multiple predicates into one definition**. Each predicate must be defined separately.

3. Output Format:
    - Each definition must be **exactly one sentence long**.
    - You must output **one line for each predicate**.
    - Each line must follow **exactly** this format:
        FOL-Predicate ::: Natural Language Definition
    - Use **exactly three colons** (` ::: `) as the separator.
    - Example:
       + Teacher(x) ::: x is a Teacher
       + DoTestSubject(x, y) ::: student x do test on y subject

4. Final Requirements:
   - The number of output lines must **exactly match** the number of FOL predicates.
   - Each definition must correspond to **only one** FOL predicate.
   - No summaries, no combined definitions, and no extra commentary.

### Task: For each given **First-Order Logic (FOL) predicate**, generate a clear and accurate **natural language definition** that faithfully captures its intended meaning based on the given natural language passage.

- A list of **FOL predicates** that represent logical relations or properties in the domain of discourse.
